IFE's casilla- and sección-level 1991 dip fed results from the 2005 redistritación CD and (apparently) the web site have sección IDs that do not match 1994-on. The 1991 seccion number starts at 1 in each municipality and (for municipalities split in two or more districts) in each federal district. From 1994 on the numbers are sequential, starting at 1 in each state.

In Aguascalientes, two new municipalites were created in 1992. El Llano and San Francisco de los Romo (from what I could figure out in maps) both are splinters from the Aguascalientes municipality. Yet seccion numbers for both new municipios are not sequential with those of their parent municipio---suggesting that IFE adopted the seccion numbers in use since 1994 that year.

Ask Marta Zertuche for seccion id equivalences 1991 and 1994-on.
