Casilla-level federal election vote returns

Note: as of October 2022, INE had not published post-TEPJF vote returns for the 2018 and 2021 at the casilla level, as it did for earlier years. The reported data includes some casillas that were voided by the tribunal. I will take note when that information is added to the data.
