What denominator to use for relative vote shares?

Since 1970s, PRI was the obvious choice. Was the hegemon. And convenient methodologically as it was never zero.

Morena's takeover has shaken that. Since 2018, the PRI began teaming up with its former main oppositions. Zero became frequent overnight.

2024 will show if Morena should become the new denominator. This methodological shift complicates temporal comparison. Reminiscent of APD's party system changes in US historical studies. Fifth party system, Sixth, and so forth.

Check Burnham and APD to view how they deal with before/after comparisons. UCSD library.

Check Molinar's identification of Mexican post 1917 party systems.
